# Waste Classification Demo
This interactive demo allows you to classify waste items using various deep learning models. Choose a model, upload an image of a waste item, and click the "Predict" button to view the top three predicted classes and their confidences. The project was developed by [Ilyesse Hettenbach](https://github.com/ilyii) and [Gabriel Schurr](https://github.com/Gabriel9753) as part of a project work at the [University of Applied Sciences Karlsruhe](https://www.h-ka.de/).  
Enjoy using the Waste Classification Demo to classify waste items and explore the capabilities of different deep learning models!

## Models
The demo currently supports the following models: [EfficientNet-B3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), [EfficientNet-B4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946), [VGG19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), and [DinoV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) in its smallest variant. The models were primarily trained on data we generated.
